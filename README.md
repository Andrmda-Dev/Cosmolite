# Cosmolite – My Custom Macropad

Cosmolite is a personal project for creating a macropad using the RP2040. It has 12 keys, 3 rotary encoders, and RGB lighting, all customizable to fit whatever needs come up. Whether it’s for speeding up workflows, gaming, or just messing around, this macropad is built to work for *me*.

### What it’s got:
- **RP2040**: Fast and responsive microcontroller to handle everything smoothly.
- **12 Keys**: Fully programmable for macros, shortcuts, or whatever is needed.
- **3 Rotary Encoders**: Great for tweaking volume, scrolling, or adjusting other settings.
- **RGB Lighting**: Customizable lighting to make the setup look and feel how I want.

This is a fun, personal project, and the firmware is open-source, so it’s all about tweaking it however I see fit.

### How it’s set up:
1. Clone the repo
2. Flash it onto an RP2040 board
3. Tinker with the keymap, encoders, and lighting to make it work just right
