# Cosmolite – My Custom Macropad

Cosmolite is a personal project where I built a macropad using the RP2040. It’s got 12 keys, 3 rotary encoders, and RGB lighting, so I can customize it however I like. Whether it's for speeding up my workflow, gaming, or just messing around, this macropad is all about fitting my needs.

### What it’s got:
- **RP2040**: Fast and responsive controller to handle everything smoothly.
- **12 Keys**: Fully programmable for macros, shortcuts, or anything else I need.
- **3 Rotary Encoders**: Perfect for controlling volume, scrolling, or tweaking other settings.
- **RGB Lighting**: Customizable lighting to add a little flair to my desk setup.

This is more of a fun project for me, and the firmware is open-source, so I can tweak it however I want. 

### How I set it up:
1. Clone the repo
2. Flash it onto my RP2040 board
3. Tinker with the keymap, encoders, and lighting to make it my own
